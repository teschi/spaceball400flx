Some experimentation code to read a Spaceball 4000 flx. 
Taken from https://github.com/arpruss/USB-Emulation and removed anything in regard to USB.

Plan is to make a poc to use it as an accessibility device to control a regular mouse. Not sure yet if:
 * simulating USB using a GreatScottGadgets Cynthion (from python)
 * using a moicrocontroller
 * or just moving the mouse from python
